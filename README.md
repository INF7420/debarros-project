# My INF 7420 Project

I will be building a travel experience website. The purpose of this project is to share my travel experiences in a unique way to inspire viewers to connect with peoples and places of the world, and with nature

## Wireframes

I value planning and user experience so I have created wireframes to show the architecture and design of my website.
